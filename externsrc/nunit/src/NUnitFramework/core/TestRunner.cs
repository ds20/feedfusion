	/// <summary>
	/// The TestRunner Interface allows client code, such as the NUnit console and
	/// gui runners, to load and run tests. This is the lowest level interface generally
	/// supported for running tests and is implemented by the RemoteTestRunner class in
	/// the NUnit core as well as by other classes running on the client side.
	/// 
	/// The Load family of methods is used to load a suite of tests from one or more 
	/// assemblies, returning the resulting test suite to the caller.
	/// 
	/// The SetFilter method provides a general approach to running only a subset
	/// of the tests. Any set filter affects future calls to CountTestCases or Run.
	/// 
	/// The CountTestCases family of methods returns the number of test cases in the
	/// loaded suite, either in its entirety or by taking a subset of tests as roots.
	/// 
	/// The Run family of methods performs a test run synchronously, returning a TestResult
	/// or TestResult[] to the caller. If provided, an EventListener interface will be 
	/// notified of significant events in the running of the tests. Methods to cancel
	/// a run and to wait for a run to complete are also provided. Test results may also 
	/// be obtained by querying the Results property after a run is complete.
	/// 
	/// BeginRun and EndRun provide a simplified form of the asynchronous invocation
	/// pattern used in many places within the .NET framework. Because the current
	/// implementation allows only one run to be in process at a time, an IAsyncResult
	/// is not used at this time.
