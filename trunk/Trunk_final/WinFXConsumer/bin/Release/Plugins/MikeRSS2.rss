&lt;p&gt;In a question-and-answer response on its Web site to the co-marketing, technology and indemnification alliance announced Thursday between Novell and Microsoft, Red Hat said that the deal "means Linux has won."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was inevitable. The best technology has been acknowledged," Red Hat said in its statement. "The relentless march of open source is shaking up the industry by freeing customers from proprietary lock-in and lack of choice."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also used its response as an opportunity to promote its own programs that protect customers from possible patent-litigation for technologies found in its Linux distribution. Part of &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/11/02/HNmsnovelllinux_1.html"&gt;the alliance between Microsoft and Novell&lt;/a&gt; protects Suse Linux users from any threat of patent litigation from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Hat also scoffed at the financial deal between Novell and Microsoft that involves up-front payments from both companies in exchange for a release of patent liability. Additionally, Novell also will make running royalty payments to Microsoft based on a percentage of revenue from open-source products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"An innovation tax is unthinkable," according to Red Hat's statement. "Free and open-source software provide the necessary environment for true innovation. Innovation without fear or threat. Activities that isolate communities or limit upstream adoption will inevitably stifle innovation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Red Hat's take on the deal, most analysts agree that the deal gives Novell a slight edge in its rivalry with Red Hat in the Linux market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has basically said, if you must run Linux in a virtualized environment ... please use Novell's SUSE Linux," wrote Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. analyst Rick Sherlund in a research note on the deal. "Novell gets a much-needed marketing boost given the relatively low market share of SUSE Linux."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A competitive edge for its biggest rival comes at a particularly bad time for Red Hat, as Oracle Corp. dealt the company a substantial blow just last week when it said &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/25/HNoracleredhat_1.html"&gt;it would begin selling technical support for Red Hat's Linux distribution&lt;/a&gt;. That plan both validates Red Hat Linux while undermining the Linux distributor's own support and maintenance business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2006 09:58:41 PST</pubDate><author>Elizabeth_Montalbano@idg.com (Elizabeth Montalbano)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/11/03/HNredhatspin_1.html</guid></item><item><title>FTC settles with adware company</title><link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/11/03/HNftcadware_1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - Adware distributor &lt;a href="http://www.zango.com/"&gt;Zango&lt;/a&gt; will give up $3 million in "ill-gotten gains" for deceptive downloads that displayed billions of unwanted pop-up ads in a settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=business;pkey=security;skey=compliance_monitoring;skey=regulatory_compliance;skey=risk_management;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=business;pkey=security;skey=compliance_monitoring;skey=regulatory_compliance;skey=risk_management;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0523130/0523130agree061103.pdf"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt;, announced Friday, bars Zango from loading software onto consumers' computers without their consent, the FTC said. The settlement also requires Zango, formerly known as 180solutions, to provide a way for consumers to remove the adware. Also named in the settlement were Zango executives Keith Smith and Daniel Todd, of Bellevue, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Consumers ... shouldn't have to accept any content they don’t want," Lydia Parnes, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement. "If consumers choose to receive pop-up ads, so be it. But it violates federal law to secretly install software that forces consumers to get pop-ups that disrupt their computer use."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zango in a &lt;a href="http://www.zango.com/destination/corporate/blog.aspx"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; released Friday, said the settlement establishes standards for software downloads and provides consumers with a "new and higher level of protection." Zango has met or exceeded the settlement's requirements since Jan. 1, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has hired an independent auditor to monitor its compliance with the FTC settlement, Zango said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the company's existence, "we relied too heavily on our affiliates to enforce our consumer notice and consent policies," Smith, the company's chief executive, said in the statement. The FTC's actions have provided "clarity around best practices," a welcome step forward for businesses providing downloaded content, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We deeply regret and apologize for the resulting negative impact,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a consumer and civil rights advocacy group that filed a &lt;a href="http://www.cdt.org/privacy/20060123180complaint.pdf"&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Zango in January, applauded the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a landmark settlement, and one that sends an important message to companies that have built their businesses on the backs of Internet users without any concern for what those users want," Ari Schwartz, CDT's deputy director, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zango often used third parties to install adware on consumers’ computers, the FTC said. The adware monitored consumers’ Internet use in order to display targeted pop-up ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zango's software has been installed on U.S. consumers’ computers more than 70 million times and has displayed more than 6.9 billion pop-up ads, the FTC said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zango’s third-party distributors often offered consumers free software, such as screensavers, peer-to-peer file sharing software, and games, without saying adware would be included, the FTC said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other cases, Zango distributors exploited security vulnerabilities in Web browsers to install the adware. As a result, millions of consumers had their Internet use monitored without their knowledge, the FTC said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC accused Zango of &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/07/17/HNadwareloose_1.html"&gt;deliberately making it difficult&lt;/a&gt; to locate and remove the adware once it was installed. Zango named its adware files with names resembling those of core systems software, provided uninstall tools that failed to uninstall the adware, gave confusing labels to those uninstall tools, and installed code on consumers’ computers that would enable the adware to be reinstalled secretly when consumers attempted to remove it, the FTC said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2006 08:41:27 PST</pubDate><author>Grant_Gross@idg.com (Grant Gross)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/11/03/HNftcadware_1.html</guid></item><item><title>ITU meeting will tackle key Internet issues</title><link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/11/03/HNitumeeting_1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - Government officials will meet in Turkey for the next three weeks to discuss the future of the Internet and take action on key issues such as cybercrime and Internet oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=broadband;skey=internet_standards;pkey=networking;skey=radio_frequency_identification_-_rfid;pkey=standards;pkey=telecom;pkey=wireless;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=broadband;skey=internet_standards;pkey=networking;skey=radio_frequency_identification_-_rfid;pkey=standards;pkey=telecom;pkey=wireless;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Plenipotentiary Conference of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), an executive arm of the U.N., will begin Monday in Antalya, Turkey. The conference will bring together government delegates from more than 190 countries to debate policy and vote on resolutions. The event directly follows the U.N.'s &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/11/02/HNnetforumclash_1.html"&gt;Internet Governance Forum&lt;/a&gt; in Athens this week, which was an informal meeting with no decisions made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference in Turkey has a jam-packed agenda that will address a wide range of topics such as the role of next-generation broadband networks, RFID (radio frequency identification) systems and network platforms and services based on IP (Internet Protocol) technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, delegates are expected to make decisions on a number of critical issues, including the ITU's role in implementing policies agreed at the two-phase World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), which took place in Geneva in 2003 and in Tunis, Tunisia, last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Two critical areas that require follow-up action are cybercrime and the concept of '&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/23/HNcybercrimecooperation_1.html"&gt;enhanced cooperation&lt;/a&gt;,' which involves discussion among governments on public policy issues such as &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/09/29/HNicannoversight_1.html"&gt;Internet oversight&lt;/a&gt;," said Robert Shaw, Internet strategy and policy advisor at the ITU. "The enhanced cooperation process was to be installed by early 2006 but it has never really happened. So action is needed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet governance was, arguably, the &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/30/HNnetgovernanceforum_1.html"&gt;most controversial issue&lt;/a&gt; at WSIS, threatening to undermine the second summit. Countries including China, Brazil and Russia had lobbied intensively for changes to the current system. The European Union, which had initially supported the status quo position of the U.S., later agreed for the need for more governmental participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of last year's summit, the U.S. government reiterated that it had absolutely no intention of relinquishing its unique position in managing the Internet but, in the end, agreed to a document that calls for changes in the way the Internet is governed today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document states that all governments should have "an equal role and responsibility for Internet governance and for ensuring the stability, security and continuity of the Internet" and should have a say in the development of "globally applicable principles on public-policy issues associated with the coordination and management of critical Internet resources." The document also speaks of "enhanced cooperation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the E.U. interprets the accord, the U.S. -- by agreeing to the wording "enhanced cooperation" -- essentially consented to consider a new oversight body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for cybercrime, Shaw pointed to several initiatives calling on the ITU to play an active role in Internet security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are areas where plenty of debate is still necessary but there are also areas, such as cybercrime, where policy-makers recognize a need to move fast," Shaw said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2006 07:43:57 PST</pubDate><author>John_Blau@idg.com (John Blau)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/11/03/HNitumeeting_1.html</guid></item><item><title>Global chip sales hit record high in September</title><link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/11/03/HNchipsalesrecord_1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - Global chip sales leaped to a record high of $21.37 billion in September, boosted by demand for mobile phones, digital music players, and PCs, the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=hardware;skey=processors;skey=memory;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=hardware;skey=processors;skey=memory;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PC memory chip sales also boosted the chip industry, as vendors add more DRAM (dynamic-RAM) to new PCs in order to keep up with the hardware requirements for Microsoft's &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/11/02/45OPenterwin_1.html"&gt;Windows Vista OS&lt;/a&gt;, SIA said. DRAM sales rose by 10 percent month-on-month, while microprocessor sales increased by 4 percent. Sales of microprocessors actually declined 11 percent compared to the same month last year due to the &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/archives/t.jsp?N=s&amp;V=80536"&gt;price war&lt;/a&gt; going on between Intel and rival Advanced Micro Devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile phone sales also boosted the chip industry, particularly on demand in India and China, SIA said, where ultra-low-cost handsets have pushed demand. Texas Instruments, the world's largest maker of chips for handsets, said in late October that ultra-low cost mobile phones are taking up a much &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/24/HNultralowcosthandset_1.html"&gt;larger share of the overall handset market&lt;/a&gt; than before, a trend it expects to continue for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The September sales record was up 9.3 percent over the same month last year, and beat the old record of $20.5 billion reported in August of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SIA predicted a strong fourth quarter for the chip industry as retailers stock shelves ahead of the holiday shopping season. The industry group reiterated its prediction for 9.8 percent global sales growth for the global industry this year.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2006 07:19:46 PST</pubDate><author>Dan_Nystedt@idg.com (Dan Nystedt)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/11/03/HNchipsalesrecord_1.html</guid></item><item><title>Microsoft unwraps Zune site</title><link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/11/03/HNmszune_1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - Microsoft unveiled a &lt;a href="http://www.zune.net/en-US/default.htm"&gt;new Web site&lt;/a&gt; that describes features of the upcoming Zune music store and also revealed that MSN Music won't continue to sell digital songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=hardware;skey=end-user_hardware;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=hardware;skey=end-user_hardware;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new site outlines details of the &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/09/28/HNzuneshipdate_1.html"&gt;Zune player&lt;/a&gt; as well as the Zune marketplace, where customers can buy songs individually or subscribe to a monthly music download service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site already features a few bands and offers downloads of images and videos of Zune advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also features accessories that will be available from third-party manufactures. A docking station will let users play music directly over speakers, a wireless remote will enable control from across the room while the Zune sits in a dock and cables will allow users to connect the Zune to their car stereos. Other accessories include leather cases and premium headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is pointing to the new Zune.net site from MSN Music, an online store that offers articles about artists as well as music sales. Now, the &lt;a href="http://music.msn.com/help/customer.aspx"&gt;customer service page&lt;/a&gt; of the MSN Music store says that starting Nov. 14, the launch date for Zune, customers will notice that the current "buy" button near songs for sale will change to links that connect to Zune and to RealNetworks' Rhapsody service. As part of a previous legal settlement with rival Real, Microsoft has agreed to promote Real's music service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Zune.net site joins two others that Microsoft has made available since revealing that it was developing the music player and store. &lt;a href="http://www.zune.com/"&gt;Zune.com&lt;/a&gt; features a short animation and simply says that zune.com is coming. Comingzune.com used to feature short animations with songs but now redirects to &lt;a href="https://www.zune-arts.net/"&gt;a site&lt;/a&gt; that contains Zune artwork and animations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late September, Microsoft revealed pricing for the Zune player and said it would launch the player and music store Nov. 14. Since its introduction of Zune, Microsoft hasn't said much about what would happen to its existing MSN Music store or how the Zune store might affect its relationships with customers like MTV Networks, which have worked closely with Microsoft to launch their own music stores.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2006 06:56:21 PST</pubDate><author>Nancy_Gohring@idg.com (Nancy Gohring)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/11/03/HNmszune_1.html</guid></item><item><title>BenQ unveils Vista-approved LCD monitors</title><link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/11/03/HNbenvistalcds_1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - BenQ unveiled some new flat-panel monitors Thursday that have been qualified to work with Microsoft's upcoming &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/11/02/45OPenterwin_1.html"&gt;Windows Vista&lt;/a&gt; operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=hardware;skey=peripherals;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=hardware;skey=peripherals;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the monitors, due out in early December, have received Microsoft's Works with Windows Vista logo. A third, due out by the end of this month, is expected to be awarded Windows Vista Premium Certification, BenQ said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Works with Windows logo indicates that a product will work smoothly with Windows Vista, although it won't necessarily offer the full Vista experience. The premium certification indicates that a product will take advantage of all of Vista's new capabilities, which include a new graphical interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Works with Vista products, called the FP93GX and FP93GS, were designed with video in mind. BenQ said it achieved a crisp moving-image quality by reducing response time across color scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FP93GX is a 19-inch monitor with a 700:1 contrast ratio and 2 millisecond response time. It will be launched in the U.S., Europe, and China in early December at a suggested retail price of $299. The FP93GS is also 19 inches across but slightly less expensive, at $260. It will be launched in Europe, Japan, and China in early December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third screen, expected to get the "premium" certification, is a 24-inch monitor called the FP241VW. It's set to hit stores in the U.S., Japan, China, and Taiwan by the end of November at a suggested retail price of $1,299.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2006 06:45:40 PST</pubDate><author>Dan_Nystedt@idg.com (Dan Nystedt)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/11/03/HNbenvistalcds_1.html</guid></item><item><title>Microsoft closes Max photo sharing project</title><link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/11/03/HNmsclosesmax_1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - Microsoft has closed a project to develop a tool, codenamed Max, for sharing photos with friends and reading RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds, among other functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=applications;skey=content_management;pkey=data_management;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=applications;skey=content_management;pkey=data_management;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/max/archive/2006/10/31/thank-you-the-max-project-has-concluded.aspx"&gt;Oct. 31 blog posting&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft said feedback from the project has contributed to development of its .Net 3.0 programming framework, and may also end up in Windows Live, a new series of Web and desktop-based applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max also let users annotate their photos, as if they were using a felt-tip pen, while the original images were preserved. In March, developers incorporated MSNBC Newsbot into Max, which pulls content from online news sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users were generally complimentary about Max, if somewhat perplexed by its features. They tended to put Max in the &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/06/14/79268_HNgooglepicasa_1.html"&gt;same category as Picasa&lt;/a&gt;, a photo sorting and sharing program owned by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Being able to trade your pictures and slide shows through a beautiful little program seems to be the goal of Microsoft Max," wrote David Kirk &lt;a href="http://blogs.tech-recipes.com/davak/2005/09/14/microsoft-max-misses-the-boat-for-now/"&gt;on his blog&lt;/a&gt;. "To their credit, it does those things well."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agency was scheduled to consider the acquisition on Friday, but on Thursday it deleted the agenda item regarding the acquisition from its Friday schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Justice already approved the acquisition in October but the FCC is split. Two commissioners have said that they're concerned about whether the deal will serve the public interest because it will reduce competition in the market. They're also responding to lobbying efforts from competitive carriers and consumer groups that have &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/06/06/78989_HNblockattbellsouth_1.html"&gt;asked the commission&lt;/a&gt; to block the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission had planned to make a decision on the acquisition in mid-October but &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/13/HNfccbellsouthvote_1.html"&gt;pushed it back&lt;/a&gt; to Friday. At the time of that delay, commissioners said that they had just received new proposals for conditions that the commission could place on the acquisition that might address some of their and competitors' concerns. They said they wanted more time to consider the ideas and to hear public comment on the proposed conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of telecommunications providers in June suggested some possible conditions that the FCC could set, including that it require AT&amp;T to continue to sell access to the AT&amp;T and BellSouth networks at current prices. That would ensure that competitors could continue to offer services under similar conditions as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also suggested that the FCC require the companies sell off some overlapping networks and sell the broadband wireless licenses that BellSouth owns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the delay in mid-October, AT&amp;T said that it is open to discussing possible conditions but that it believes that no conditions are necessary for the merger to benefit the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;T and BellSouth announced the deal in March. They require FCC approval before it can become final.&lt;/p&gt;

The terms of the deal weren't disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=business;skey=mergers_and_acquisitions;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=business;skey=mergers_and_acquisitions;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPL develops revenue and operations management software for utilities, and tax management software for government agencies. Customers such as electric, gas, and water utilities use the software for customer care and billing, mobile workforce management, outage and distribution management, and asset management. Government agencies use SPL's software to help manage their financial relationships with constituents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the acquisition, Oracle said it will be in a unique position to offer an end-to-end packaged revenue and operations management solution for utilities. Often, conventional software products are customized for the utility market but the result is usually inefficient, inflexible and expensive, Oracle said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPL employees will become a business unit within Oracle working on utility-specific products and continuing to develop the government tax management software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle recently said that it plans to continue to pursue its &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/23/HNoracleacquisitions_1.html"&gt;strategy of acquiring companies&lt;/a&gt; as a way to drive growth. Over the past two years, the software giant has bought 20 companies. On Thursday, Oracle &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/11/03/HNoraclestellent_1.html"&gt;announced it will buy&lt;/a&gt; content management software developer Stellant for $440 million.&lt;/p&gt;

The company both participates in development of PHP and offers products around the server-side development platform. Andi Gutmans, a cofounder of the company and its vice president of technology, spoke with &lt;i&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/i&gt; Editor at Large Paul Krill this week at the Zend/PHP Conference &amp; Expo in San Jose, Calif., about PHP, the company's &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/31/HNzenphp_1.html" class="regularArticleU"&gt;blockbuster deal with Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, and other happenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=application_development;skey=rich_internet_applications_-_ria;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=application_development;skey=rich_internet_applications_-_ria;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;InfoWorld: What do you see as the significance of Microsoft’s collaboration with Zend that you announced the other day?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutmans: The significance is definitely that Microsoft has come to acknowledge the size of the PHP community and also the fact that there is an overlap. There are a lot of PHP users who are interested in getting good PHP support in Windows. And I think with [Microsoft General Manager of Technical Platform Strategy] Bill Hilf's recent work, it shows that Microsoft is now really willing to do what's right for their platform, and also cooperate with its competition in certain areas of interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;InfoWorld: You don’t think Microsoft would rather just have those users develop on Visual Basic or C++?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutmans: Oh, definitely. I mean in a perfect world, all those developers would be .Net developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;InfoWorld: Perfect for Microsoft?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutmans: Exactly. That’s obviously what they would like. And you know, they’re not hiding that either. But on the other hand, they realize that that’s not the case and that’s probably never going to be the case. And it’s very hard to ignore a community of 4.5 million developers and have those developers go to Unix and Linux platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;InfoWorld: What is Zend’s role in the development of the PHP scripting language?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutmans: We’re contributors to the language and the language implementation itself. So, kind of the JVM [Java Virtual Machine] of PHP is called the Zend Engine, and that was originally developed by [Zend Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer] Zeev Suraski and myself in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;InfoWorld: Who is the founder of PHP?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutmans: Rasmus Lerdorf. He wrote the original version. And then in 1997 we wrote PHP 3. We helped write that.  And then the big rewrite came about a year or two later, which was PHP 4 and the Zend Engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;InfoWorld: What were the main goals in the development of PHP?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutmans: The main goal is being the best Web development language. The big advantage of PHP is that we are solely focused on the Web and Web services. And that is what makes the language so powerful. We don’t try [to] be a general-purpose language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;InfoWorld: Is Zend profitable these days, leveraging open source technology like PHP?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutmans: Currently we’re still in the investment stage. In the summer, we completed Series D round [financing], a $20 million round. And so we are still investing in growing the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;InfoWorld: How does PHP compare to other scripting languages such as &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;AJAX&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), Ruby, Perl, Python, JavaScript? AJAX is not a language per se. How does PHP compare to all these others?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutmans: AJAX and JavaScript are the technologies that are used on the client side. And PHP works very well in conjunction with that. So they complement each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;InfoWorld: What about Ruby, etc?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutmans: It’s also a dynamic language like those other languages, like Perl and Python.  But PHP is by far the most popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;InfoWorld: Why do you think PHP is the most popular?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutmans: I think because of our very, very strong focus on the Web. We’ve always been the most efficient when it comes to developing Web applications. And also it’s a very, very easy language to pick up. So you don’t have to have to be a software engineer or a computer science graduate to use PHP. I often say that PHP is the Visual Basic of the Web. You can just be kind of an ad hoc developer, no real formal training, and be very, very efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;InfoWorld: Does PHP displace Java on the server side?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutmans: No, I don’t think it completely displaces Java. .. I think there is a bit of an overlap.  And there’s no doubt that there is a trend moving from Java to PHP for Web applications, because Java is too complicated and takes too much time to develop. But there are certain areas where you’d continue to use Java and you wouldn’t use PHP. For example, in non-Web related things such as back-end finance systems that [do] two-phase commits, transaction management, message queues. You wouldn’t use PHP there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;InfoWorld: What’s going on with Zend and PHP as far as the Eclipse platform?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutmans: Zend joined IBM and we partner with IBM to develop PHP language support in Eclipse. We joined the Eclipse Foundation as a strategic developer. I am Zend’s board member on the Eclipse Foundation's board. And we really see this as an opportunity to significantly increase the ecosystem around PHP. [We want to] allow companies to leverage the PHP work we’re doing in Eclipse and provide their users, in most cases Java users, very good integration with PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;InfoWorld: You don’t see any clash between what Zend is doing and what you’re doing with Eclipse in PHP?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutmans: No. First of all, it very much complements what we call our collaboration strategy or collaborative strategy, where we try and increase and build the ecosystem around us and PHP.  And secondly, we also plan to leverage Eclipse for our own products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;InfoWorld: Which products would those be?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutmans: We will be definitely using the Rich Client Platform of Eclipse for [a new] GUI in the Zend Guard product [for intellectual property protection].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;InfoWorld: How will you use it for the Zend Guard product?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutmans: It’s like a management GUI. … We use the Rich Client Platform as the underlying technology.  And we will also be providing development tools that are built on Eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;InfoWorld: What is your take on the Oracle announcement last week about supporting Red Hat Linux?  Do you think this is a death knell for Red Hat?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutmans: I’m not sure. If Oracle succeeds, I don’t know if it’s a death knell. I think still a lot of vendors are going to prefer kind of the best-of-breed vendor for Linux. But [Red Hat] could lose some business, especially the Oracle business. [Red Had has] got some pricing pressure… There’s obviously another option, which is that Oracle is just trying to drive down the price [of Red Hat stock]. And maybe this is a one- to two-year plan to actually acquire Red Hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;InfoWorld: Was there anything else you wanted to touch on that I’m not thinking to ask about?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutmans: I think maybe about IBM. We have a very strong partnership with IBM.  And I don’t know if you follow the System i?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;InfoWorld: The old AS/400?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutmans: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;InfoWorld: What’s happening with that?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutmans: What’s happening there is about five years ago IBM ported J2EE over to System i in order to re-energize the platform, Web enable it. And that was very unsuccessful because it was very hard for COBOL and RPG developers to adopt Java. It’s just too complicated.  And so they are getting behind PHP now because they see that as being the real solution to Web-enabling the platform, getting those developers moved over. So we announced, I think it was in March, we announced a multi-[year], multi-million dollar OEM deal with IBM. And they’re shipping Zend Core and Zend Studio to their customers for free as part of that OEM deal. Right now it looks extremely promising. I mean it really seems their community is extremely enthusiastic and receptive of PHP.  And we’re seeing some of the biggest System i users looking to adopt PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;InfoWorld: Who is your competitor in the PHP space?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutmans: We don’t really have a competitor right now. It’s like we don’t have one competitor really that has a solution like us.  There are all sorts of little shops that do all sorts of things.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2006 05:30:00 PST</pubDate><author>paul_krill@infoworld.com (Paul Krill)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/11/03/HNgutmans_1.html</guid></item></channel></rss>
