&lt;p&gt;Stephen Benedict, AOL Instant Messenger's principal product manager, was scheduled to announce a new set of Web-based APIs (application programming interfaces) and "widget" mini-applications at a developers' conference on Thursday, an AOL spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these new tools, programmers who don't work at AOL will be able to build AIM features into external Web sites. For example, the "presence" API would allow a user to display on his Web site his AIM availability status, "away" message and profile. With the "IM Windows" API, users could embed an AIM chat window on a Web page and use it to send and receive messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AOL plans to release four APIs and three widgets in a few weeks at &lt;a href="http://developer.aim.com/"&gt;http://developer.aim.com&lt;/a&gt; as an extension of &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/03/06/76123_HNaolopensaim_1.html"&gt;the Open AIM Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, announced in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall goal of the Open AIM program is to facilitate the development of AIM plug-ins, the creation of AIM user interface applications and the integration of AIM presence information into Web sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AOL's efforts are in line with a wider trend among providers of online services like Yahoo Inc. and Google Inc. With APIs, external developers can create applications that extend these companies' online services, adding features to them and in theory making them more attractive and useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's not about me versus Mark or who gets the credit. The legacy will take four or five years to be clear," Fiorina said in Silicon Valley Thursday to promote "Tough Choices: A Memoir," a book about her career, including five and a half years as president, chief executive officer and chairman of the technology firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiorina was &lt;a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/techwatch/archives/001078.html"&gt;fired by HP's board in February 2005&lt;/a&gt;, about three years after completion of the merger she pushed between HP and Compaq Computer Corp. HP's stock price languished in the wake of the$19 billion merger, there were problems with integration of the two companies and HP missed one quarterly earnings estimate by a sizable 23 percent on her watch. Since Hurd replaced her in April 2005, the company's stock price has doubled and its revenue and profitability increased. It is now set to end fiscal 2006 with more than $90 billion in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Fiorina questioned the notion that her leadership wasn't working and that Hurd turned things around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Missing a quarter is not a good thing, but a transformation is not a 90-day process," Fiorina said to an audience of about 400 people at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. And even though HP is now competitive with IBM Corp. and Dell Inc., "it didn't just happen in the last 12 months [that Hurd has been CEO]." Transforming HP was "like turning an oceanliner ... not a jet ski," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiorina signed copies of her book, which chronicles her career culminating in her hiring in 1999 as HP's CEO and chairman, which made her an icon for women in the business world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Carly is such an important role model for so many of us," said Chris Melching, chief executive officer of the Forum for Women Entrepreneurs and Executives, who attended the forum. "She's all about the importance of being true to yourself."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiorina only touched briefly on &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/archives/t.jsp?N=s&amp;V=81745"&gt;the scandal currently confronting HP&lt;/a&gt;, the filing of state criminal charges against ousted chairman Patricia Dunn, an HP lawyer and three private detectives, for allegedly using illegal methods to obtain phone records to track down the source of leaks from the HP board to the media. Fiorina learned her own phone records had been obtained under false pretenses. She investigated board leaks when she was at the company, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phone records scandal is just the most recent example of what Fiorina called a "dysfunctional board" that she also had to deal with when she was chairman and CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group becomes dysfunctional, "when people can't put disagreements on the table," she said. "When people can no longer speak plainly about tough issues ... bad things happen."&lt;i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2006 12:47:27 PDT</pubDate><author>Robert_Mullins@idg.com (Robert Mullins)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/19/HNfiorina_1.html</guid></item><item><title>Cingular's mobile data revenue soars</title><link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/19/HNcingrev_1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - Mobile data services helped drive up average customer spending for Cingular Wireless LLC in the third quarter, the largest U.S. cellular operator said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=broadband;pkey=networking;pkey=telecom;pkey=wireless;skey=3g;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=broadband;pkey=networking;pkey=telecom;pkey=wireless;skey=3g;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monthly spending by the average customer was US$49.76, up from $49.65 during last year's third quarter. It was the first time their spending had risen year over year since the company acquired AT&amp;T Wireless in October 2004, according to company spokesman Mark Siegel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data services were a major factor in the gain, he said. Average spending on data services rose to $6.32, up 46 percent from a year earlier and 10 percent from the second quarter. Ringtones, downloadable games, instant messaging, e-mail and photo messaging are increasingly popular, as are bundles of various data services, according to Cingular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carrier had 28 million active data customers in the third quarter, out of a total of 58.7 million subscribers, the nation's largest customer base, the company said. Its total subscribers grew by 6.4 million from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As prices for voice calls have fallen, Cingular and other mobile operators have invested in expensive high-speed networks and looked to data services to boost revenue and profits. Customer adoption had been slow in the U.S. but is now picking up for some services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total revenue for the quarter was $9.6 billion, up 9.2 percent from a year earlier. Net income was $847 million, compared with $222 million a year earlier. Siegel attributed the boost in profit to lower costs resulting from the merger with AT&amp;T Wireless. The company completed the integration of the two networks during the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cingular is a joint venture of AT&amp;T Inc. and BellSouth Corp. AT&amp;T's acquisition of BellSouth is expected to close following approval by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2006 12:29:59 PDT</pubDate><author>Stephen_Lawson@idg.com (Stephen Lawson)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/19/HNcingrev_1.html</guid></item><item><title>Irked users seek clarification over Vista licensing</title><link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/19/HNvistaclarification_1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - Windows users have raised concerns about Microsoft Corp.'s new licensing for Windows Vista that will allow them to transfer a Vista license to only one machine other than the computer for which it was purchased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=operating_systems;pkey=platforms;skey=windows;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=operating_systems;pkey=platforms;skey=windows;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/16/HNmsvistaonetransfer_1.html"&gt;The new licensing&lt;/a&gt; has caused confusion, especially for power users who rebuild their computers with new components several times a year, or who plan to upgrade their computers more than once in the lifetime of the OS. Users are demanding clarification from Microsoft about how scenarios like these will play out under the new licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My question about the one time transfer is what constitutes a machine?" asked Windows user Roger Halstead. "I have four machines and they are running legal copies of XP Pro. Those four machines are in a constant state of upgrade. I have to reactivate the OS around three or four times a year due to upgrades."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halstead said that if he is not allowed to continuously upgrade his machine without purchasing new licenses, then "Vista will not be a viable operating system for me."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I can stay on XP Pro, which I probably will as long as I can, but what happens when MS no longer supports XP?" he asked. "If I have to do a reinstall, will I be able to get it to work?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Microsoft has so far been unable to answer these kinds of questions from users. Contacted Wednesday morning Eastern Daylight Time to clarify Vista's licensing in such an instance, by Thursday morning Microsoft's public relations firm still did not have an answer from the vendor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don Smutny, a software developer for the DST Technologies division of DST Systems Inc. in Kansas City, Missouri, considers the one-license transfer a message from Microsoft that "they don't care if you ever run Vista."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He, too, said it's not clear what Microsoft constitutes as a new PC that would require another Vista license purchase. However, with XP, it's considered a license transfer with "every motherboard, CPU or hard-drive upgrade," he said. If Microsoft follows the same tack with Vista, things could get extremely complicated and pricey for users, Smutny said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that this kind of move from Microsoft is the sort of thing that would inspire users to switch to an alternative desktop if it was easy to transfer and use Windows applications on that platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If someone could come up with a Linux distribution that was just as easy to use as XP and included Windows emulation software that would allow users to play their Windows-based games without a large performance hit, then you will finally see the shift of OS use that the Linux folks have been saying is 'coming soon' for the last 10 years," Smutny said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's not the only user who is downright angry with Microsoft for its new licensing practice. Another Windows user, Mark Smith, who has his own business developing custom data-acquistiion and analysis packages for industrial applications, said it shows how "arrogant" Microsoft has become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It knows that governments (both the U.S. and E.U.) are essentially powerless to effect any changes to the Microsoft status quo," he said via e-mail. "It also knows there are no real competitors (Apple and Linux notwithstanding). So it's new attitude is to hell with the customer, we're going to do whatever we want because the customer has no choice but to buy Vista."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Smutny, Smith added that he, too, has been on the lookout for years for a viable alternative to Windows so he does not have to do business with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I've tried all the competitors and hoped that IBM would have stuck it out and created a viable competitor; they were close," he said. "There certainly is a huge market, so we can always hope."&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2006 09:56:39 PDT</pubDate><author>Elizabeth_Montalbano@idg.com (Elizabeth Montalbano)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/19/HNvistaclarification_1.html</guid></item><item><title>Microsoft chips away at piracy in the UK</title><link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/19/HNmspiracyuk_1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - Microsoft's door-to-door campaign to ferret out copyright infringers in the U.K. has reduced the piracy rate for its software sooner than expected, company officials said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=business;pkey=security;skey=compliance_monitoring;skey=regulatory_compliance;skey=risk_management;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=business;pkey=security;skey=compliance_monitoring;skey=regulatory_compliance;skey=risk_management;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's "Keep IT Real" program, &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/02/16/75468_HNmsukantipiracy_1.html"&gt;launched in February&lt;/a&gt;, has cut the piracy rate for Windows XP from 16.7 percent to 12.4 percent for the Windows XP OS said Michala Alexander, head of antipiracy for the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We were really pleased to see the rate dropping so quickly," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the program's onset, Microsoft said it wanted to reduce the rate to 11.7 percent within three years, but now aims to hit that goal by next February, Alexander said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft gives partial credit for the piracy decline to its Windows Genuine Advantage (WGA) program, an application on client computers that checks with the company's servers to see if the OS copy is legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft calculated the &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/06/27/79681_HNwgachange_1.html"&gt;drop in piracy using WGA&lt;/a&gt;, Alexander said. The latest figures show that of some 31 million copies of Windows in the U.K. that have been checked, 12.4 percent of those are illegitimate copies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Keep IT Real program takes an aggressive approach, with teams of investigators visiting resellers and PC builders in person and emphasizing the terms and conditions of licensing agreements. Software Asset Management teams also drop in to Microsoft customers and audit software licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company investigators found 13 customers were using some 5,000 pieces of counterfeit software, including Office, Windows Server and Windows OS, Alexander said. Microsoft is also currently suing seven companies for allegedly selling unauthorized software in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will turn its sights now on counterfeit copies of Office, Alexander said. Up to 33 percent of the copies of Office are not authorized software, often propagated through casual sharing, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure is taken from a similar tool on Microsoft's Web site that checks to see if Office is legitimate. About 1 million people in the U.K. have checked so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2006 09:41:25 PDT</pubDate><author>Jeremy_Kirk@idg.com (Jeremy Kirk)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/19/HNmspiracyuk_1.html</guid></item><item><title>IDC: 1 billion phones should sell this year</title><link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/19/HN1billionphones_1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - Mobile phone users are on track to buy 1 billion handsets this year, said IDC as part of its report on third quarter sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=hardware;pkey=wireless;skey=phones;skey=end-user_hardware;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=hardware;pkey=wireless;skey=phones;skey=end-user_hardware;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 254.9 million phones shipped during the quarter, an increase of 7.9 percent compared to the previous quarter and up 21 percent over the same quarter last year, IDC said. That means that phone makers should ship a total of 1 billion phones this year, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth at the top and bottom of the market is fueling sales. The trend at the high end is shifting from very slim phones to handsets with digital music players, IDC said. While full-featured phones are drawing buyers in mature markets, sales of low-cost phones are growing in emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top two handset makers improved their market shares. &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/19/HNnokiaprofit_1.html"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt;, which sold 88.5 million phones during the quarter, had 34.7 percent of the market, up from 31.6 percent in the third quarter last year. Despite a 45 percent decline in profit during the quarter, compared to the year-earlier period, Motorola's share of the market grew to 21.1 percent compared to 18.4 percent in the same period in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics maintained its third spot in the rankings, with 12 percent of the market and shipping 30 million phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications managed to hold on to the number four position in shipments for the quarter after stealing the spot from LG Electronics during the second quarter. Sony had 7.8 percent of the market in the quarter and LG Electronics had 6.5 percent, down from 7.4 percent in the third quarter of 2005.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2006 09:29:39 PDT</pubDate><author>Nancy_Gohring@idg.com (Nancy Gohring)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/19/HN1billionphones_1.html</guid></item><item><title>Kagermann: Cautious but optimistic about SAP growth</title><link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/19/HNsapgrowth_1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - SAP Chief Executive Officer Henning Kagermann is cautious but optimistic about the company's medium-term growth after the software maker on Thursday &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/19/HNsapgrowth_1.html"&gt;reported another strong sales performance&lt;/a&gt; in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=business;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=business;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our figures exceeded expectations," Kagermann said in a conference call. "We outperformed the market and gained 1 percent market share."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kagermann added that the company's SafePassage program, designed to lure customers away from rival Oracle, now has more than 400 customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nine months into the 2006 business year, Kagermann said the company, while within its guidance figures, is at the lower end and is "less likely" to edge up by year's end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of the year, SAP forecasted 2006 software license revenue to increase between 15 percent and 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Kagermann declined to provide guidance figures for 2007, he said he doesn't see any changes in the market that could slow down demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Pricing remains tough but stable," he said. "We don't expect any changes -- for better or worse."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kagermann acknowledged Salesforce.com as a competitor with its on-demand applications but said SAP has countered with new on-demand offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, SAP reported a 17 percent increase in third-quarter software license revenue, an important gauge of future fees from consulting and maintenance, to €691 million ($877 million as of Sept. 30, the last day in the period being reported) from €590 million in the same period a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total revenue in the third quarter increased 11 percent to €2.2 billion from €2.0 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net sales for the quarter were €10.1 billion ($12.8 billion as of Sept. 30, the last day of the period reported), up 20 percent from €8.4 billion in the same quarter a year earlier. Net profit was €845 million, down 4 percent from €881 million a year earlier, Nokia said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company sold 88.5 million devices in the quarter, up 33 percent from the same quarter a year earlier. That helped to boost Nokia's share of the market to 36 percent of all devices sold, from 34 percent in the second quarter of this year, it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average selling price of its phones dropped sharply, however, to €93, down from €102 in the second quarter, continuing a trend from the past several quarters. The lower prices were due to "a significantly higher proportion of entry-level device sales," the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia also sold fewer high-end devices as a proportion of its total sales, due to slow take-up of wideband CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) products across the industry, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, Nokia's president and chief executive officer, said in a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This was an impressive quarter in many respects," he said. "However, the quarter was not all positive, and we have more work to do."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average selling prices are dropping in part due to the &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/04/20/77595_HNnokiaprofits_1.html"&gt;quick growth of emerging markets&lt;/a&gt;. In China, where the company has partnered with China Mobile Communications to penetrate rural markets, device sales increased 62 percent from a year ago. Sales also grew strongly in southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emerging markets represent a double-edged sword for phone makers: They can sell more devices there, but they have to sell them at prices people can afford, which can eat into profits. Kallasvuo suggested that Nokia may be willing to absorb the lower prices rather than yield market share to competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We'll not walk away from this good business," he said of the emerging markets. "We'll take advantage of future upgrades as they come."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating profit from Nokia's mobile phone group dropped 11 percent to €779 million, even though net sales from the group climbed 14 percent to €5.9 billion. Along with the lower selling prices, profits were also reduced by a charge of €128 million, related to the restructuring of Nokia's CDMA business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's enterprise solutions group, which sells its Eseries devices, reported an operating loss of €65 million, compared to a loss of €37 million a year earlier. The increased loss was due primarily to increased marketing spending, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit sales of the Eseries devices increased 60 percent, however, and the company expects even higher sales in the fourth quarter. That, along with increasing sales of its Nseries multimedia phones, could help lift average selling prices and improve profits, said Rick Simonson, Nokia's chief financial officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past quarter, net sales from its multimedia phones division climbed 45 percent to €2.1 billion, while operating profit grew 49 percent to €366 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the fall in net income, diluted earnings per share at the phone maker increased to €0.21, up 5 percent from the same quarter a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2006 07:36:05 PDT</pubDate><author>James_Niccolai@idg.com (James Niccolai)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/19/HNnokiaprofit_1.html</guid></item><item><title>SAP remains on growth path in Q3</title><link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/19/HNsapgrowth_1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - Demand for business application software from SAP appears stronger than ever, with the German company reporting yet another quarter of significant sales growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=applications;pkey=business;skey=customer_relationship_management_-_crm;pkey=data_management;skey=enterprise_resource_planning_-_erp;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=applications;pkey=business;skey=customer_relationship_management_-_crm;pkey=data_management;skey=enterprise_resource_planning_-_erp;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software license revenue, a gauge of future fees from consulting and maintenance, rose 17 percent in the third quarter to €691 million ($877 million as of Sept. 30, the last day in the period being reported) from €590 million in the same period a year earlier, SAP said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total revenue in the third quarter increased 11 percent to €2.2 billion from €2.0 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buoyed by strong sales, net income in the third quarter rose 16 percent to €388 million, or €1.27 per share, from €334 million, or €1.08 per share, in the year-earlier period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/04/20/77610_HNsapusdriver_1.html"&gt;the company's fastest growing market&lt;/a&gt;, SAP posted its 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter software license revenue in the U.S. climbed 15 percent to €228 million. License revenue in the Americas was up 19 percent to €292 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, software revenue rose 14 percent to €301 million, with Germany -- SAP's home market -- showing a 3 percent increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software revenue in the Asia-Pacific region was up 22 percent to €98 million. In Japan, an underperforming market for SAP in recent months, revenue surged 51 percent to €39 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAP confirmed its forecast that 2006 software license revenue should rise between 15 percent and 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2006 07:05:59 PDT</pubDate><author>John_Blau@idg.com (John Blau)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/19/HNsapgrowth_1.html</guid></item><item><title>MessageLabs obtains $60M loan to boost research</title><link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/19/HNmessagelabsresearch_1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - MessageLabs, one of a handful of smaller security vendors competing in a cut-throat market, has secured a $60 million loan that it will use to bolster its research and development efforts, the company said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=anti-virus;pkey=application_development;skey=application_security;pkey=applications;skey=collaboration;skey=desktop_security;skey=e-mail;skey=im;skey=internet_applications;pkey=security;skey=viruses_and_worms;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=anti-virus;pkey=application_development;skey=application_security;pkey=applications;skey=collaboration;skey=desktop_security;skey=e-mail;skey=im;skey=internet_applications;pkey=security;skey=viruses_and_worms;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The private Gloucester, England, company will double its 10-person research team in Toronto by July, complementing its 80-person U.K. team, said Jos White, MessageLabs co-founder and chief marketing officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two engineering teams will work on meshing &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/06/26/79627_HNmessagelabsupgrade_1.html"&gt;MessageLabs services&lt;/a&gt;, which include e-mail, IM (instant message), and Web traffic filtering, White said. MessageLabs differs from other security vendors in that a client's e-mail or IM traffic is diverted to one of the company's datacenters where it is cleansed of malicious content. The service is sold on subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineers will work to integrate the management of those services, such as setting policies to block certain attachments in e-mails, into a single portal, White said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MessageLabs has identified Japan and Germany as locales ripe for growth with their heavy use of e-mail and messaging services and a need for security, White said. The company will work to localize its products in those countries, targeting small to midsize businesses plus larger enterprises, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MessageLabs is vying for a &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/02/04/HNsecure_1.html"&gt;larger share of a security market&lt;/a&gt; dominated by Symantec, McAfee, and Trend Micro, which collectively held about 86 percent of the market during 2005, according to research firm Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gartner reported in June that the antivirus software market is expected to experience &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/06/21/79506_HNantivirusmarket_1.html"&gt;double-digit growth over the next year&lt;/a&gt;, with increased interest in suites covering several security concerns, such as spam, viruses, and hacking attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White said MessageLabs increased its revenue 37 percent year-over-year for its fiscal year, which ended July 31. The company turned its first-ever profit of $2.3 million since it was founded in 2000, White said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loan, which came from Lloyds TSB Bank, is due in three years, said Stephen Chandler, chief financial officer at MessageLabs.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2006 06:43:44 PDT</pubDate><author>Jeremy_Kirk@idg.com (Jeremy Kirk)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/19/HNmessagelabsresearch_1.html</guid></item></channel></rss>
