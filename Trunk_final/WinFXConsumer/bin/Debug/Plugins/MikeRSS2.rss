Excessive charges for Web surfing, music downloads, and games were among the main reasons given by consumers interviewed for a study conducted by German market researcher TNS Infratest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=applications;skey=broadband;skey=mobile_applications;pkey=networking;pkey=telecom;pkey=wireless;skey=3g;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=applications;skey=broadband;skey=mobile_applications;pkey=networking;pkey=telecom;pkey=wireless;skey=3g;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of its Global Tech Insight 2006 study, published Wednesday, the market researcher asked 16,000 consumers in 29 countries about 3G services. Only 4 percent said they viewed 3G as an important function of mobile phones, down 1 percent from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly one quarter, or 23 percent, of the polled consumers cited high costs as the main hurdle to 3G takeup. As many attributed high costs as the key obstacle to downloading music and games to mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of those subscribing to 3G services, many view streamed mobile TV service and Web surfing on mobile handsets as expensive and unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While high costs were their main gripe, consumers also listed transmission speeds, battery life times, picture quality and storage as other areas of dissatisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They cited transparent, &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/06/13/79255_HN3geatup_1.html"&gt;affordable flat-rate plans&lt;/a&gt; as a way to make 3G services more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also opening the second stage of infringement proceedings -- sending so-called reasoned opinion letters -- in eight cases currently under examination. Meanwhile, nine ongoing cases have been closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of cases in the new round concern a failure to complete market reviews to assess the status of competition on national telecom markets or the lack of caller location information to emergency authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Commission remains vigilant in ensuring that the E.U.’s regulatory framework for electronic communications is correctly implemented," said Information Society and Media Commissioner Viviane Reding. The Commission is the E.U.'s executive and regulatory arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Similarly, the availability of caller location information for the Single European Emergency Number 112 needs to be urgently addressed in all member states," Reding said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New cases are being opened against Denmark, Germany, Malta and Portugal, for failing to conduct the required market reviews. Estonia and Luxembourg have already been warned about this and have still failed to conduct the reviews, so the Commission said it is sending reasoned opinion letters -- the second step in legal action -- to both countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Czech Republic, meanwhile, has now conducted all 18 of the market reviews, allowing the Commission to close its case against the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission said it will also open new cases against Slovakia, Germany, Sweden, Belgium and Luxembourg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A letter of formal notice is being sent to Slovakia, where number portability is still lacking. A similar letter is being sent to Germany because the must-carry rules in various federal states do not conform with the requirements of the Universal Service Directive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new infringement proceeding has been opened against Sweden because only an operator with significant market power has a right of appeal against the results of the market review in that country, the Commission said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belgium has been officially warned for failing to reveal the cost of providing universal service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neighboring Luxembourg has fallen foul of the Commission because its national regulatory authority has never verified the incumbent's cost accounting system or published an annual statement of compliance, as required under E.U. telecom rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second step in legal proceedings was opened against six member states (Greece, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Italy and Portugal) where caller location information is not provided for all calls to the Single European Emergency Number 112. For Ireland, Cyprus and Luxembourg, the pending proceedings could be closed after national authorities confirmed that caller location information is now available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In France, a comprehensive directory is now available, so this case has also been closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since number portability is now fully available in Malta, Poland and Slovenia, these three cases have been closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, proceedings against Greece for failing to transpose the ePrivacy directive into national law have been closed after the Greek government confirmed the directive has now been transposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A detailed overview of the state of infringement proceedings is available on the DG Information Society and Media’s implementation and enforcement &lt;a href="http://europa.eu.int/information_society/policy/ecomm/implementation_enforcement/index_en.htm#Infringements"&gt;Web site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2006 08:20:15 PDT</pubDate><author>Paul_Meller@idg.com (Paul Meller)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/12/HNtelecominfringement_1.html</guid></item><item><title>Vista-ready products to ship by holidays</title><link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/12/HNvistareadyproducts_1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - Microsoft continues its efforts to inform customers that they can purchase products compatible with &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/09/01/HNmswindowsvistarc1_1.html"&gt;Windows Vista&lt;/a&gt; as soon as the operating system is available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=operating_systems;pkey=platforms;skey=windows;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;skey=operating_systems;pkey=platforms;skey=windows;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Digital Life 2006 Conference in New York on Thursday, Microsoft is expected to announce that more than 250 hardware and software products have received either the "Certified for Windows Vista" or "Works with Windows Vista" logos, and will be available in time for the holiday shopping season in November and December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Windows Vista was originally supposed to ship for consumers around the same time, Microsoft in March &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/03/24/76795_HNvistaprobsworse_1.html"&gt;pushed back that release&lt;/a&gt; until January 2007. Business users should have Vista sometime in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Products tagged "Certified for Windows Vista" will deliver a premium Windows Vista experience, while those tagged "Works with Windows Vista" are compatible with the OS and will work reliably with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Sievert, corporate vice president of Windows Client Marketing at Microsoft, is expected to highlight Vista-ready partner products in his keynote at the Digital Life show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sievert also is expected to show products still undergoing the logo testing process. Those products will include Canon's HV-10 HD Camcorder, Nvidia GeForce graphics cards, Logitech’s MX3200 Laser cordless desktop set and the MX Revolution mouse, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also will highlight that ATI Technologies, Canon, Logitech, and Nvidia have products available that have already qualified for the Certified for Windows Vista logo, and other companies, such as Belkin, CA, Corel, and D-Link Systems, will have Certified for Windows Vista products available around the same time Vista is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been making a major push to have PCs and third-party products ready to run on and with Windows Vista once it ships. PCs labeled "Windows Vista Capable" and "Windows Vista Premium Ready" are already on the market thanks to a program Microsoft launched with hardware partners earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCs with the Windows Vista Capable logo can run lower-end versions of Vista, such as Windows Vista Home Basic. Meanwhile, Windows Vista Premium Ready means the machines can run the higher-end versions of Vista, such as Windows Vista Home Premium and Windows Vista Ultimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the partner product news, Sievert on Thursday also will announce that two key software features of Vista -- Internet Explorer 7 (IE7) and Windows Media Player 11 -- will soon be available for Windows XP. IE7 will be made available to Windows XP customers via free download in the next two weeks, and Windows Media Player 11 will be available as a free download beginning Oct. 24, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2006 07:41:10 PDT</pubDate><author>Elizabeth_Montalbano@idg.com (Elizabeth Montalbano)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/12/HNvistareadyproducts_1.html</guid></item><item><title>Palm strengthens ties with Asian operators</title><link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/12/HNpalmasiansales_1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - In a bid to replicate the Treo's U.S. success in Asia, Palm has reworked its distribution strategy, betting that closer ties with Asian operators will translate into higher smart-phone sales in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=hardware;pkey=wireless;skey=phones;skey=end-user_hardware;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=hardware;pkey=wireless;skey=phones;skey=end-user_hardware;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We need to replicate the momentum we have in the U.S. in other parts of the world," said Paul Blinkhorn, Palm's vice president for Asia-Pacific, during a recent news conference held to &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/09/28/HNpalm3ghandset_1.html"&gt;announce the company's Treo 750v smart phone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treo line of smart phones represents the bulk of Palm's business, accounting for $269 million of the $356 million in revenue earned during the company's fourth quarter, which ended Aug. 31. Palm shipped 623,000 smart phones during the period&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Palm does not break out smart-phone revenue by geographical region, the bulk of the company's overall revenue comes from the U.S., according to a company filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. International sales accounted for 17 percent of Palm's worldwide revenue during the last quarter, down from 25 percent during the same period one year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The success of our business strategy and our smart phone products is highly dependent on our ability to establish new relationships and build on our existing relationships with domestic and international wireless carriers," the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palm's recent announcement of the Treo 750v, a Windows-based 3G (third generation) smart phone that went on sale in Singapore this month through operator MobileOne, is part of a wider deal with Vodafone Group and an important step for Palm. "It's the first major exercise with a carrier outside the United States," Blinkhorn said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationships that Palm has built with U.S. operators, like Verizon Wireless, have been critical to the Treo's success in that market. This strategy has been successful because operators can subsidize the device and bundle it with their high-speed networks, Blinkhorn said, adding Palm hopes to repeat that success in Asia through its partnership with Vodafone, which also covers Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Here in Asia-Pacific, we have moved from, and are continuing to move from, a broad-based distribution model ... to a stronger focus on working with specific carriers," Blinkhorn said, noting that Palm is in talks with Vodafone and its partners in several Asian countries to release the 750v in those markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is one Asian market that will not be getting the 750v any time soon: China. Vodafone's Chinese partner is China Mobile Communications, the country's largest operator, but the absence of 3G licenses there prevents Palm and China Mobile from offering the 750v.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"China Mobile is a slightly complicated matter and the complication is that legally you can't sell a 3G product into China at this particular point in time," Blinkhorn said, noting that regulation will likely remain in place until the government issues 3G licenses.&lt;i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2006 07:24:37 PDT</pubDate><author>Sumner_Lemon@idg.com (Sumner Lemon)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/12/HNpalmasiansales_1.html</guid></item><item><title>In Brief: HTC unveils Wi-Fi smartphone for T-Mobile</title><link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/12/HNhtcsmartphonebrief_1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - Taiwan's High Tech Computer (HTC) Wednesday announced a new cellular handset for the U.S. market that offers a full QWERTY keyboard and support for Wi-Fi. The phone, called Dash, is based on Microsoft's Windows Mobile software and is the first from HTC to offer a full QWERTY on the phone's face, similar to Research In Motion's popular BlackBerry handset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=hardware;skey=wi-fi;pkey=wireless;skey=phones;skey=end-user_hardware;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=hardware;skey=wi-fi;pkey=wireless;skey=phones;skey=end-user_hardware;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the Dash's other features, it offers a 2.4-inch LCD screen with a resolution of 320 pixels by 240 pixels and support for GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) and EDGE (Enhanced Data Rate for GSM Evolution) networks. The phone also offers a 1.3-megapixel camera, Bluetooth support, and a slot for microSD (Secure Digital) memory cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dash will be sold in the U.S. through mobile operator T-Mobile USA beginning on Oct. 25.

&lt;p&gt;The Commissioner in charge of the internal market, Charlie McCreevy, wants the European Union to become a signatory to the European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA) -- a draft accord tabled by the European Patent Organization (EPO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once ratified, the EPLA would create one single patent court for all 31 countries that are members of the EPO, including the 25 members of the European Union. Presently, patents can be disputed in individual countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCreevy supports the EPO's claim that one single court would create more legal certainty for those involved in patent disputes in Europe. Participation in the EPLA would be a pragmatic alternative to the long delayed attempts to agree one single patent regime for the E.U., known as the Community Patent, McCreevy said earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he hasn't given up on the 30 year-long aim to create a Community Patent, but he is pursuing the EPLA agreement as a plan B -- an interim step, designed to help innovation in Europe in the absence of a Community Patent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) sought "significant improvements" to McCreevy's plan B, said parliamentary spokesman Federico de Girolamo. "A vast majority of MEPs called for changes, including assurances of the independence of judges and clarity on the costs of litigation," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have also asked their own lawyers to find out whether the overlap of E.U. and EPO laws could pose a problem, De Girolamo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They didn't reject the EPLA idea outright," he said, explaining that the position, which was supported by around 500 MEPs, was a compromise between the different political parties. The socialists, for example, were opposed to the EPLA idea from the start, while other large parties were more supportive of the idea, De Girolamo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While asking the Commission to go back and redraft the proposal, the Parliament asked them to consider alternatives, such as for the E.U. to join the EPO, instead of signing up to its latest agreement. They also urged the Commission to consider reviving the Community Patent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporters of open source and free software believe the EPLA is a disguised way of imposing software patents in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florian Mueller, the founder of the NoSoftwarePatents campaign that last year helped to block the passing of an E.U.-wide law on the patenting of computer implemented inventions (dubbed the software patent directive) said the EPLA is even more onerous than the law he helped defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's just another attempt to give software and business method patents a stronger legal basis in Europe than they have now," he said in July at a hearing in Brussels. "From a software patents point of view, the EPLA would have far worse consequences than the rejected patentability directive would have had: not only would software patents become more enforceable in Europe but also patent holders in general would be encouraged to litigate," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent court proposed under the EPLA would use EPO judges and apply the EPO's approach to the patentability of software, Mueller said more recently in blog postings. National patent offices take a more guarded approach to issuing software-related patents. The EPLA would force all countries to apply the same approach as that of the EPO, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mueller also argues that there is no need for an EPLA because less than 10 percent of patent disputes involve more than one country. "We are talking about between 75 and 150 patent disputes a year, and most of those relate to disputes involving just two countries, rather than three or more," he said on his website http://www.no-lobbyists-as-such.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week the EPO hit out at criticism from parts of the software industry that the organization is in favor of granting software patents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The proportion of computer-implemented inventions is obviously growing, as innovation tends to rely more and more on the information technology incorporated in a growing number of devices, from cars to washing machines to cell phones," EPO president Alain Pompidou said at a conference in Lisbon on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"However, let me make it quite clear that the EPO does not have its own agenda on software patents. In accordance with the 1973 European Patent Convention (EPC), the EPO does not grant patents for computer programs as such, but it does grant patents for computer-related inventions that are novel, inventive and of a technical character."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The non-obviousness criterion, as well as the novelty and the technical character requirements, are strictly applied by the EPO," Pompidou said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mueller was unimpressed with Pompidou's argument. "His 'computer-related inventions' include such concepts as a context menu or checking for virus activity in a computer and are essentially the same as the software patents granted by the USPTO (the US patent office), just that the descriptions are phrased slightly differently over here," Mueller said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He and his fellow lobbyists working on the 'nosoftwarepatents' campaign have drawn up a list of the worst software patents to be passed by the EPO this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top of the list is patent number EP1044400: an Internet-based service for updating a programmable control device. The list can be &lt;a href="http://www.nosoftwarepatents-award.com/vote200610/patent1.en.html"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCreevy hoped that by going down the EPLA route he would avert a full-blown lobbying war between the pro- and anti-software patent groups. But it now seems that even this more modest initiative will be fiercely debated, and the delicate issue of software patentability will remain center stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2006 06:57:35 PDT</pubDate><author>Paul_Meller@idg.com (Paul Meller)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/12/HNeupatentagreement_1.html</guid></item><item><title>Nokia completes navigation software company buy</title><link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/12/HNnokiacompletesbuy_1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - Nokia completed its acquisition of navigation software company Gate5 on Thursday, just a week after licensing hundreds of navigation patents from Trimble Navigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=applications;pkey=business;skey=mobile_applications;pkey=wireless;skey=mergers_and_acquisitions;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=applications;pkey=business;skey=mobile_applications;pkey=wireless;skey=mergers_and_acquisitions;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gate5 will become part of Nokia's multimedia business group, and continue to be based in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia announced its intent to acquire Gate5 in August and uses software from the company in the N95, the new smartphone Nokia introduced in late September that includes GPS (Global Positioning System) and mapping applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gate5 acquisition joins another Nokia foray into the navigation market. Last week the world's largest mobile handset manufacturer &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/02/HNnokialicensespatents_1.html"&gt;licensed 700 patents from Trimble&lt;/a&gt; and also acquired the exclusive right to sublicense the patents to other vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gate5 and Trimble activities appear to fall in line with a new strategy at Nokia to try to own or control new technologies that are integrated into mobile phones. At an event last week, Nokia pointed to the fact that once it began integrating cameras into mobile phones, the handset maker quickly became the largest vendor of digital cameras. Yet traditional camera makers hold the majority of patents for digital cameras so Nokia must pay to license the relevant patents. "We need to be conscious of the cost of integrating these technologies," said Ulla James, director of intellectual property rights strategic marketing for Nokia, during the event in Helsinki last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She suggested that the next new cell phone function that will become popular is location based services. With the Trimble and Gate5 deals, Nokia is in a better position to capitalize on the trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia plans to continue to support multiple platforms for Gate5 products, including Symbian, Linux, Windows Mobile and Palm, pointing to another unique strategy for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia is increasingly branching out into products and services that it sells to competitors. For instance, late last year the handset maker announced plans to acquire Intellisync, a push e-mail software company, in a deal that closed earlier this year. At the time, critics wondered if Nokia would find it challenging to sell the product to competitors. Earlier this month, however, Palm Inc., a Nokia competitor, launched a device in Mexico running Intellisync software. Nokia also licenses its Symbian-based S60 operating system to other handset makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia also said on Thursday that it has opened a sales unit for location based services in Hong Kong, targeting customers in Asia-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2006 06:49:33 PDT</pubDate><author>Nancy_Gohring@idg.com (Nancy Gohring)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/12/HNnokiacompletesbuy_1.html</guid></item><item><title>Orkut comes under fire in India</title><link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/12/HNportalsunderfire_1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - Google's Orkut social networking site has put it in the middle of a border dispute between India and Pakistan. A petition filed in an Indian court against an anti-India community hosted by Orkut could have implications for other portals operating in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=applications;skey=internet_applications;skey=portals;pkey=web_services;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=applications;skey=internet_applications;skey=portals;pkey=web_services;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All network service providers with operations in India will have to ensure that their sites are not used to promote content inimical to the country or which promotes hate and violence, if the petition, filed by Yugant R. Marlapalle with the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court, is successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I am all for freedom of speech, but it should not be at the expense of the rights of the people of India," Marlapalle, a lawyer by profession, said in an interview Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aurangabad bench issued a notice to Google, its Indian operation, and the Indian government last week in connection with an anti-India campaign on one of the communities on Orkut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move by the High Court came after Marlapalle filed a petition before the court under India's Information Technology Act 2000 (IT Act), petitioning that the court direct Orkut to remove the community "We Hate India" which has a picture of the burning of the Indian flag, besides some anti-India propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community, set up by a Russian, Miraslov Stankovic, states that it is against all those people who are against Pakistan. The community is about having a group of people who have enmity against India because of its oppressive and hostile approach, it says in the description of the community. The number of members of the community as on Thursday was 91, down from 100 the previous day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India and Pakistan have a long feud over the disputed territory of Kashmir, which is partially under Indian control. This dispute has spilled over into online communities, web sites, and discussion groups. There are a number of "Hate Pakistan" communities on Orkut too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google takes the issue seriously, a spokeswoman for Google India said Wednesday. The company had however not yet received a notice from the court, she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marlapalle said that he and other objectors used a feature of the Orkut site to report the group as "bogus", and also sent a letter on Aug. 28 to Google's operation in Mumbai, India, demanding the removal of the community. Marlapalle subsequently filed the petition on Sept. 11, and it came up for hearing on October 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marlapalle has also petitioned the court to instruct the government of India to appoint a Controller as provided for in the IT Act. Under the Act, the controller can "direct any agency of the Government to intercept any information transmitted through any computer resource" in the interest of the sovereignty or integrity of India, the security of the country, friendly relations with foreign states or public order.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2006 06:28:24 PDT</pubDate><author>John_Ribeiro@idg.com (John Ribeiro)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/12/HNportalsunderfire_1.html</guid></item><item><title>EU gears up for fight over passenger data</title><link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/12/HNpassengerdatavote_1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - European Union parliamentarians are gearing up for a fight over data privacy, after justice ministers from the 25 countries in the E.U., together with the European Commission, signed a new temporary &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/06/HNeuus_1.html"&gt;agreement to pass over airline passenger data&lt;/a&gt; to American authorities last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=business;skey=privacy_issues;pkey=security;skey=regulatory_compliance;skey=risk_management;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=business;skey=privacy_issues;pkey=security;skey=regulatory_compliance;skey=risk_management;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debating the agreement late Wednesday, many members of the European Parliament criticized the deal, which grants U.S. government agencies greater access to the passenger name record information than under a previous agreement that was &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/11/23/HNdatatransferillegal_1.html"&gt;deemed illegal by the European Court of Justice&lt;/a&gt; in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The European Union has completely capitulated to U.S. demands on this issue," Sylvia Kaufmann, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) with the European United Left/Nordic Green Left alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The fact that the CIA, an agency whose activities, torturing and kidnapping, this house is investigating in a special committee, will have access to passenger data is the real scandal, especially when one considers that the right of redress held by U.S. citizens is not extended to E.U. citizens," she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A temporary agreement was essential to &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/02/HNairlinesinlimbo_1.html"&gt;avoid chaos for Europe's airlines&lt;/a&gt;. The Court of Justice said in May that the old agreement would become legally void at the end of September. Without a replacement, airlines could have been sued in Europe if they handed over private data including names, addresses and credit card details. On the other hand, if they withheld that same information from the U.S. authorities, they could be fined or lose landing rights in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new temporary agreement is valid until July 2007 and will have to be replaced by a longer-term agreement. But some MEPs argued Tuesday that Europe's ability to negotiate a long-term deal that better protects passenger data has been hampered by the Commission and the justice ministers' enthusiasm for the temporary deal reached last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Having now signaled to the whole world their premature satisfaction (with the temporary agreement), with what negotiating clout and what specific European demands for improvements will they be approaching the negotiations for the conclusion of a final Agreement with their U.S. counterparts in a few months' time?" asked Stavros Lambrinidis, a Greek socialist and the vice chairman of the Parliament's civil liberties committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Franco Frattini, the European Commissioner in charge of justice issues, criticized Parliamentarians for being anti-American. "It's terrorism that is the problem, not the United States of America," he said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2006 06:12:20 PDT</pubDate><author>Paul_Meller@idg.com (Paul Meller)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/12/HNpassengerdatavote_1.html</guid></item><item><title>U.S. military to deploy IBM translation in Iraq</title><link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/12/HNibmtranslation_1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - The U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) will deploy IBM's speech-to-speech translation software to help U.S. forces serving in Iraq better communicate with local security forces and Iraqi citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=applications;skey=speech;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=applications;skey=speech;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USJFCOM acts as the "transformation laboratory" of the U.S. military developing and testing out new capabilities and then recommending their use to the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. The unit is turning to IBM and other companies for technology to translate natural speech in real-time to make up for a lack of military linguists proficient in Iraqi Arabic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM announced Thursday that the USJFCOM will deploy IBM Research's Multilingual Automatic Speech-to-Speech Translator system, also known as Mastor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastor combines work on automatic speech recognition, natural language understanding and speech synthesis underway at IBM since 2001, said David Nahamoo, chief technology officer, human language technology at IBM Research. Over the last few years, IBM has also worked closely on Mastor with the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When used in Iraq, Mastor will act as an automated bi-directional, English-to-Iraqi Arabic translator capable of translating more than 50,000 English words and 100,000 Iraqi Arabic words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a U.S. military trainer looking to work with an Iraqi policeman could speak English into a microphone hooked up to the Mastor system running on a laptop. The IBM technology would recognize his English speech, translate it into Iraqi Arabic and then vocalize that translation for the Iraqi policeman to hear and vice versa. Mastor's graphical user interface displays both the original and translated phrase. It also includes what IBM calls a "back translation" of the individual words the system translated, to provide an additional level of confidence to the original speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, IBM will deliver 35 ruggedized Panasonic Toughbook laptops loaded with the Mastor software to USJFCOM in Iraq later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The system is designed for a benign environment," Wayne Richards, deputy branch chief, USJFCOM capabilities division, wrote in an e-mail interview. "Its recommended uses are hospitals, training of Iraqi police and military forces in classrooms and in secure training areas on force protection and civil affairs operations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USJFCOM had input into the English and Iraqi Arabic words Mastor has been taught to recognize, Richards added. The agency transcribed and translated conversations that reflected particular mission areas so it could capture specific words, terms and expressions for use in developing translation libraries leading to improvements in the accuracy in Mastor's translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The [Mastor] product is not ready for full deployment and is being put into the field in a controlled environment which will be assessed by the government; feedback will be provided to DARPA, who will use the analyses to increase the technical readiness of the system," Richards wrote. DARPA will use the feedback to help guide IBM in further research and development efforts to improve Mastor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has previously worked on three other language versions of Mastor to varying extents -- English-to-Mandarin Chinese, English-to-Modern Standard Arabic and English-to-Spanish -- Nahamoo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's keen to explore other avenues for the technology and already has a relationship in place with a commercial partner, Sharp Corp. The Japanese company is to introduce a Japanese-to-English translation personal digital assistant (PDA) later this year that is based on some of IBM's technologies in Mastor, notably its speech recognition and its text-to-speech capabilities, Nahamoo said.&lt;/p&gt;
