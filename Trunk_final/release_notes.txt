Troubleshooting
---------------

1.
Q: After I install, FeedFusion doesn't start, it gives an error.

A: If you had a prelease version of .NET 3.0 framework, check that you uninstalled it successfully and ran the Microsoft cleanup tool afterwards. Then Run the installer again and .NET 3.0 final will be automaicaly installed. The program should work now.

2. 
Q: I receive strange errors when i am not logged in as administrator.

A: Some of the settings need administrator rights to change (write access in FeedFusion install location) . To fix, install FeedFusion in a folder with write-access.

3. 
Q: After using it a while , FeedFusion starts to work slower and slower. What is happening?

A: When the database size increases it is normal to encounter a slower response time. Delete the history to fix the problem. (Options->User Options->Delete history)
